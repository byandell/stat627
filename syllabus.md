Statistics 627: Professional Skills in Data Science  
Fall 2018 (3 cr) Class Hours: TBD; Office Hours: TBD 1120 MSC  
Instructors: Brian Yandell <http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~yandell>  
Contact: 263-3304; [brian.yandell@wisc.edu](mailto:brian.yandell@wisc.edu)  

**Course Description:** This course is aimed at providing graduate students with an understanding of and experience with professional skills in data science. Researchers today must organize data projects to be able to repeat tasks and share data, ideas, reports and code with others in diverse teams. They need to do this quickly in real time and on a longer term, being able to reproduce tasks -- either their own or those of others -- months or years later. To do this well, researchers as data scientists need to be skilled with internet tools, sophisticated use of statistical languages (such as R) and other emerging topics.  

**Learning Objectives:** After completing the course, a student will be able to

* use RStudio as platform for statistical computing
    + install and use RStudio application on personal computer
    + use RStudio on departmental computers
* use [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) language for literate programming
    + build documents as a project evolves to capture work flow
    + share results with collaborators in a team
* understand data representation in R, including
    + read, manipulate and display data summaries in concise tables
    + work with data frames using [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) tools
    + visualize data with the [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) package
* organize work into well documented collections
    + create functions to collapse repeated steps into one-line "verbs"
    + organize functions and data into packages (R libraries) to share
    + use [git and github](http://happygitwithr.com/) to keep track of code and document changes with version control
    + document work with RMarkdown
* understand aspects of underlying statistical computing algorithms, including
    + the R formula language and its use for fitting linear models and generalized linear models
    + contrast specifications for factors and their impact on interpretation of coefficient estimates
* make sound choices about algorithm efficiency and graphical presentation
    + use code profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and logic errors
    + use simulation to study statistical properties
    + create graphics to diagnose patterns in raw and derived data
* appreciate benefits and challenges of other statistical language choices
    + use unix/linux shell to search project
    + import/export data from/to other statistical packages
    + understand basic idea of pipelines and workflows

**Computer software:** R, RStudio and related applications. Text: Reference materials will be provided online. Assignments: There will be periodic assignments.  
**Exams:** There will be no exams.  
**Grading:** Based on homework (80%) and class participation (20%). There will be homework every other week. Optional final project will replace one homework.
